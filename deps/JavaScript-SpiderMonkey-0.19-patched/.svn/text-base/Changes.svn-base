    (tb) Removed remaining debug info

0.13 (05/02/2006)
    (tb) Removed debug info
    (tb) Made sure Makefile.PL finds libjs if installed in /usr/lib or 
         /usr/local/lib

0.12 (12/03/2005)
    (ms) Makefile.PL prerequisite changed from undef to '0'.
    (ms) Thomas Busch added a check to Makefile.PL to find an already
         installed JS lib.

0.11 (08/22/2004)
      * (ms) Added Log::Log4perl dependency in Makefile.PL as suggested
             by an anonymous posting on rt.cpan.org.
      * (ms) Added #define for MSC compiler as suggested in
             https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=6984
      * (ms) Roger Crew <crew@cs.stanford.edu> provided patches for
             a clean Win32 compile plus README text on installing the dll/so.

0.10  06/20/2004
      * Nikita Savin <nikita@savin.go2serve.net> provided a patch to 
        set $@ instead of printing to STDERR in case of a JS error.
      * Added patch by Chris Blaise <cblaise@esoft.com>:
          - Different objects can have the same named function. If no
            object is specified on function_set, it's global.
      * Log4perl in for debugging
      * Chris Blaise submitted a patch to have a perl callback return
        an object to JS. Applied with modifications, longer term we need
        a solution on how the perl callback tells the JS wrapper what's coming
        back: A JS string, an object or an integer.
