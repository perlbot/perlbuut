How to install JavaScript::SpiderMonkey

Get the latest SpiderMonkey distribution from mozilla.org:
http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey shows which releases are available.
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/js/js-1.5-rc3a.tar.gz has been proven to work.

Untar it at the same directory level as the distribution of the
JavaScript::SpiderMonkey perl module distribution whichs README
you're currently reading:

cd ..
tar zxfv js-1.5-rc3a.tar.gz

It's important that the js and JavaScript-SpiderMonkey-v.vv directories
are at the same level:

$ls
JavaScript-SpiderMonkey-1.00  
js
js-1.5-rc3a.tar.gz

Now, build JavaScript::SpiderMonkey in the standard way:

cd JavaScript-SpiderMonkey-1.00
perl Makefile.PL
gmake
gmake test
gmake install

-- and you're good to go! Have fun.
